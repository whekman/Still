# Still

Still is a Python based static photo website generator that builds a pure HTML/CSS based hierarchical overview of your photos, optimally resizes and copyrights your photos, and removes sensitive metadata (EXIF).

# Why

Most of us would like to share our photos with friends and family in a convenient way but are now forced to use 3rd party services to do so (eg Google Photos). While these services work they force you to use at times unnecessarily complicated API's.

If you just want to create a clear and effective website section to host your photos, and you have access to a webserver to do so then Still might be just what you are looking for. 

# Quick Start

Clone the repo and place your photo albums in the appropriate folder. Then follow the instructions in the main Jupyter Notebook to set the global variables needed to resize and copyright your photos. Run the main function to generate your hierachical website section.

# Contribution

- Theming: It would be great to offer various CSS theme options. If you are into CSS it would be great if you could contribute more themes.
- Additional Features: If you can think of additional features, that would be great. Maybe a randon photo page?
